# DialogueSystem

I created (with the help of tutorial found on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnhvu99A1tg&list=PL1BpAHJuerXwirR2evFhBgXCh0XlcAB8d) an dialogue system.

Using a NodeTree, you can have a dialogue system with multiple option using xml files.
I also create a simple WPF to create and edit the xml files.
